RADIUS


1. The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol was developed by Livingston Enterprises, Inc., as an access server authentication and accounting protocol


2.Communication between a network access server (NAS) and a RADIUS server is based on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

3. Generally, the RADIUS protocol is considered a connectionless service

4. Issues related to server availability, retransmission, and timeouts are handled by the RADIUS-enabled devices rather than the transmission protocol.

5.RADIUS is a client/server protocol.

6.The RADIUS client is typically a NAS and the RADIUS server is usually a daemon process running on a UNIX or Windows NT machine

7. The client passes user information to designated RADIUS servers and acts on the response that is returned


8.  RADIUS servers receive user connection requests, authenticate the user, and then return the configuration information necessary for the client to deliver service to the user

9.   A RADIUS server can act as a proxy client to other RADIUS servers or other kinds of authentication servers
